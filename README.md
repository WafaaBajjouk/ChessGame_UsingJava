# ChessGame_UsingJava


In this project Iâ€™m implementing the rules of the chess game on java codes using the object-oriented programming language concepts ( to revise the whole concepts )
the game of Chess is played by two people. The goal of Chess is to maneuver your pieces in an effort to remove your opponent's pieces and ultimately capture his or her King. The chess pieces are represented as JAVA classes ,
the chess board is generated by JAVA GUI swing using the builder pattern
